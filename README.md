# 🎯 Student Marks Predictor – ML Model Deployment using Flask & HTML

This is a real-world **end-to-end machine learning project** where we predict **student marks** based on the number of **hours studied**.

---

## 📌 Business Problem

A university reports that:
- No students score above 90%
- Most students average below 60%

The management suspects that **study hours might be a key factor**.  
They need a **tool** to predict how much a student might score based on how many hours they study.

---

## 🔍 Solution

We built a **Machine Learning regression model**, deployed it using **Flask**, and created a **web interface** where users can enter hours and get predicted marks instantly.

## 💡 How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repo or download ZIP
2. Make sure Python is installed
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

4. Run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

5. Open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

6. Enter hours, click "Predict Marks", and see results in real-time

---

## 📊 Output Example

For 5.0 hours studied → 📈 Predicted Marks: **70.13%**
If you enter invalid input like -2 or 25 → ❌ Shows error message

---

## 🧠 Deployment Insight

This app runs on an **application server**.
In real-world companies:

* Developers work on app servers with dummy/duplicate data
* Deployment means moving code from **app server** → **production server**
* Production servers have restrictions (security, access, firewall)
* Model and data must be validated for live use
